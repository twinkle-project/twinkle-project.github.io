<!--<h1 style="color: #ADBAC7; text-align: center;"> Twinkle for Digital Twins </h1>
Twinkle is a project within the PRIN (Progetti di Ricerca di rilevante Interesse Nazionale) Program 2022 for Research projects of national interest. Prot. 20223N7WCJ, Project ‘‘TWINKLE’’, CUP: E53D2300777 0001. The project has been founded by the European Union - Next Generation EU (Finanziato dall'Unione Europea – Next Generation EU).


<h3 style="color: #101821; text-align: center;"> Why the Twinkle Project? </h3>
Digital Twins (DT) are evolving from their original research field and emerging as a new cross-domain paradigm for design and implementing cyber-physical applications through the creation of synchronized software replicas of physical devices, products, and organizations, usually called Physical Assets (PAs). They are moving fast towards a widespread adoption beyond industrial and manufacturing contexts, as a general way to bridge the physical and the digital spaces, also thanks to the pervasive diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) and Web technologies, that extend their applicability across challenging cross-domain use cases. This challenging pervasive DT evolution calls for new software architectures and approaches featuring levels of flexibility beyond the ones provided by the solutions available in the state-of-the-art that are building DTs mainly as passive components, without interoperable modeling, and through several platform-specific silos. Currently, each model is built from scratch without common methodologies and with the concrete risk of generating a strong vendor lock-in and blocking the creation of a real open ecosystem where PAs, DTs, and applications can cooperate through an effective service continuum. To fully harness their potential, a new pervasive and open DT framework is required to both shape twins as active entities with their own behaviors and make them seamlessly collaborate with applications and services through distributed environments. On one side, there is the need for an effective modeling of DT core capabilities, life cycle, and shadowing process to properly shape and describe the digitalization process and its quality. On the other hand, the design of DT-driven applications should be enabled by an effective and seamless management of available computing, communication, and storage resources to provide a continuum across cloud, fog, and edge layers to deploy and orchestrate DT instances according to cyber-physical requirements and constraints.

Accordingly, the overall objective of the project is to investigate, define and experiment a new open and distributed DT platform -- here referred to as Digital Twin Continuum (DTC) – to enable the design, deployment, and maintenance of the next-generation of intelligent cyber-physical applications focusing on 3 main research pillars:

DT As Service: envisioning a pervasive use of DTs as services virtualizing any relevant logical or physical assets to be consumed by an application layer on top, away from the DT-as-silo view;
Ecosystems of DT: envisioning dynamic ecosystems of connected/linked DTs, mirroring complex dynamic ecosystems of inter-related PAs;
Deployment Independence, envisioning the possibility of having a flexible and dynamic deployment of DTs at different network levels, from edge to cloud, according to need, optimizing orchestration, monitoring, and performance across multiple execution points.-->

Digital Twins (DT) are evolving as a versatile paradigm for cyber-physical applications, bridging the physical and digital realms. Our project aims to develop a new open and distributed DT platform, Digital Twin Continuum (DTC), focusing on three main research areas: DT As Service, Ecosystems of DT, and Deployment Independence.*
