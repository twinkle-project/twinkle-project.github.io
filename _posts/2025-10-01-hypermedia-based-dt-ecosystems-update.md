## Hypermedia-Based Digital Twin Ecosystems: A Proposal for Digital Twin Interoperability

- Authors: A. Giulianelli, S. Burattini, A. Ciortea, A. Ricci

We are pleased to announce the publication of our latest research on advancing interoperability in Digital Twin (DT) ecosystems through a hypermedia-based, Web-oriented approach. Starting from the increasing need to connect diverse DTs—often built with different technologies and by various stakeholders—the study identifies key challenges in integrating heterogeneous systems.​

Our work proposes an architecture, the Hypermedia-based Web of Digital Twins (HWoDT), which leverages Web standards and semantic descriptions to provide a uniform interface and enable seamless navigation, data sharing, and querying across DTs. This solution is validated with a case study in healthcare, demonstrating how diverse DTs can be integrated to support coordinated monitoring and management.

The main findings show that hypermedia and semantic web principles can overcome technological fragmentation, enabling scalable, cross-domain ecosystems where applications and organizations can collaborate more efficiently. This framework marks an important step toward open, adaptive, and future-proof DT solutions.
