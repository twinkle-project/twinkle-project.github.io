## Engineering Interoperable Ecosystems of Digital Twins: A Web-based Approach

- Authors: A. Giulianelli, S. Burattini, A. Ciortea, A. Ricci

We are excited to announce the publication of our paper on how to build interoperable Digital Twin (DT) ecosystems with web technologies. The research stems from the need to move beyond isolated DTs and aims to create open and connected systems that can communicate with each other, even when developed on different platforms.

We have developed an architecture based on web standards that allows us to describe, access, and integrate DTs in multi-domain contexts, fostering collaboration between organizations. Validation is achieved through a real-world use case involving both healthcare and urban infrastructures, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

The main results show that the interoperability, modularity, and scalability offered by the web make it possible to create flexible and easily integrated digital ecosystems, opening up new opportunities for services and applications independent of the underlying technologies.
