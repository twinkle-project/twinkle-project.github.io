We are pleased to announce the publication of our research article exploring the dual nature of interoperability in Digital Twins (DTs), critical for bridging the gap between physical assets and cyber systems. The study highlights how DTs must adapt to both physical heterogeneity—integrating with diverse devices and protocols—and digital heterogeneity, by connecting to various applications and services.

Starting from these challenges, we propose a modular software architecture that leverages physical and digital adapters to manage complexity and enable seamless interaction between the physical and digital worlds. Our approach encourages the use of standardized descriptions and interfaces, increasing reusability and simplifying integration.

The findings are validated through an industrial use case, demonstrating how this architecture simplifies the creation and management of DTs in complex, heterogeneous environments. Overall, the research lays the groundwork for highly interoperable, future-proof digital twin solutions across industrial domains.
