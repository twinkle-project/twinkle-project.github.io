We are excited to announce the publication of our research on the integration of Digital Twins (DTs) with Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines to streamline the deployment of intelligent functions in industrial cyber-physical systems.

Starting from the growing complexity and fragmentation present in industrial IoT environments, our work proposes a modular approach where DTs act as structured, interoperable gateways for data and intelligence. The ZeroConf concept allows AI and ML models to be automatically integrated—minimizing manual configuration, accelerating data preparation, and enabling efficient model deployment.

Through tests on a MicroFactory case study, we demonstrate how DTs can automate data management, quality control, and anomaly detection, supporting concurrent models and dynamic analytics. Our findings confirm that this architecture reduces integration effort, enhances scalability, and speeds up the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.

This research paves the way for more flexible and automated AI solutions, enabling smart, adaptive, and resilient manufacturing processes.
