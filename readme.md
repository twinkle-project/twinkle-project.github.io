# Digital-Twin Twinke Project
Digital Twins (DT) are evolving as a versatile paradigm for cyber-physical applications, bridging the physical and digital realms. Our project aims to develop a new open and distributed DT platform, Digital Twin Continuum (DTC), focusing on three main research areas: DT As Service, Ecosystems of DT, and Deployment Independence.*

Twinkle is a project within the PRIN (Progetti di Ricerca di rilevante Interesse Nazionale) Program 2022 for Research projects of national interest. The project has been funded by the European Union - Next Generation EU (Finanziato dall'Unione europea â€“ Next Generation EU).*
